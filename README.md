# Pygame-Catch-Me-If-You-Can

As part of our Advanced Python class, my classmate Ricky and I developed a pygame application called 'Catch Me If You Can!' It a simple and fun game where you, an excorist, try to catch the ghost. the more the number of ghost you catch, higher your scores. 

The game is similar to tetris game where the instead of the snake we use the wiitchhunting story. 

To run this application, download the images and background music and image. 

Run the kernal and Pygame interface would let you play the game.
